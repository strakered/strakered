MelodyGeneratorApp

  Project Description

I am developing an innovative app aimed at supporting composers, particularly those facing creative blocks, through artificial intelligence.
The goal is to create an app that automatically analyzes instrumental audio tracks, extracts a melody, and returns it as a synthesized voice.
Additionally, the app will offer the ability to modify the generated notes, allowing musicians to explore new melodic and harmonic ideas.
Currently, there is no application on the market with these advanced melodic generation capabilities, which gives this project strong competitive potential.

Key Features

  1) Advanced Audio Analysis: Decomposes instrumental audio tracks to identify the main melodic line.
  2) Customizable Vocal Synthesis: Utilizes vocal synthesis models (such as Tacotron, WaveNet, or equivalent) to transform the extracted melody into a sung artificial voice.
  3) Real-time Note Modification: Provides an intuitive interface for customizing notes, enabling composers to explore different melodic variations to enrich their creativity.

Required Technologies and Skills

  1) Machine Learning/Deep Learning: Experience with frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, knowledge of sequential models (RNN/LSTM) or transformers for audio signal processing.
  2) Vocal Synthesis Technologies: Familiarity with architectures like Tacotron or WaveNet for vocal generation.
  3) Audio Processing: Skills in using libraries like librosa, Essentia, or similar for audio analysis and preprocessing.
  4) Frontend Development (optional): Experience in developing interactive audio user interfaces, preferably with React or Flutter for potential mobile app implementations.

Collaboration Details

I currently do not have a budget for upfront compensation, but I offer an equal division of any profits generated from the project.
I am looking for creative, curious, and passionate individuals about AI and music, ready to work on a project that can make a difference for musicians and composers.

Why Join Us?

This project is designed to be an ally in music composition and can open unique opportunities for those involved in a rapidly growing field.
I believe this tool could revolutionize the way composers approach melody, eliminating creative blocks and facilitating idea generation.
